cd simple-calculator
npm install
This will install all the required dependencies for the app.

3. Start the app

npm start
This will start the development server and open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Project Structure
src/App.js: Contains the main logic and components for the calculator.

src/App.css: The styles for the calculator layout and buttons.

public/index.html: The root HTML file that contains the div element where the app is rendered.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

npm test

For more info about running tests in React, check out the Create React App Testing Documentation.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes it for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is now ready to be deployed.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation! Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back.
If you want full control over the build configuration (Webpack, Babel, etc.), you can eject. However, this is generally not necessary unless you need deep customization.
